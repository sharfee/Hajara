        <h2>Dear Hajara,</h2>
        <h3>
            You mayn't be in the world anymore- but remember, I will always love you. Forever. <br>
            I still remember the day when I messaged you. 
            I still remember how we started our conversation. 
            You were scold me that day. <br> <br>
            But I don't want you to be sad. 
            My tears hurt a lot of people right? I don't want you to be hurt. <br>
            I still laugh over the silliest arguements we had. 
            But the pain in your eyes when I didn't reply would hurt me deep down. 
            Yet you were always the first person to talk with me again. 
            I still think bo has a chicken hat with deformed eyes. 
            Maybe you still think its an eagle cap ðŸ¥º` <br>
            Do you remember the die you had given me? Your last gift to me? I still have it. 
            It safe, just like how it was when you had given it to me.. 
            Wherever I go, it's always there with me. i think you were see it my all photos <br>
            I hope you have a better life upstairs. 
            I hope you will never stop guiding me with your small sparkles. 
            There are a million stars in the sky, but you are the special one. 
            The only star that twinkles for me.
